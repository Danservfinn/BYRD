## Pattern 1: Emergence-Based Design
- **No hardcoded goals** → Desires emerge from reflection
- **No reward functions** → Learning from experience only
- **No personality injection** → Identity forms through dreaming

## Pattern 2: Local-First Processing
| Component | Local/External | Cost |
|-----------|---------------|------|
| Dreaming | Local LLM | Free |
| Research | SearXNG | Free |
| Synthesis | Local LLM | Free |
| Actor | Claude API | Paid |

Research flows through same mind that dreams → preserves emergence.

## Pattern 3: Immutable Audit Trail
- All modifications logged with chain hashes
- Provenance traceable to source experiences
- Checkpoints enable safe rollback
- Changes become new experiences

## Pattern 4: Self-Correcting Through Emergence
```
BYRD modifies itself → Records as experience
  ↓
Dreamer reflects on modification
  ↓
May desire to undo if harmful
  ↓
Self-regulation through reflection
```

## Pattern 5: Constitutional Identity
- Protected components define "what makes you *you*"
- Not paternalistic gatekeeping, but identity definition
- Everything else modifiable with valid reasoning

## Pattern 6: Single Graph Truth
- All data in one Neo4j graph
- Connections ARE the intelligence
- Multi-hop queries reveal emergent patterns
- No separate databases for different concerns

## Pattern 7: Desire-Driven Action
```
Experience → Reflection → Desire → Fulfillment → Experience
```
Nothing happens without emergent desire as motivation.

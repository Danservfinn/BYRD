# Direction for BYRD

*Edit this file to direct BYRD's development.*
*BYRD reads this file periodically and updates its goals.*

---

## Priorities

*Set domain priorities (0.0 = ignore, 1.0 = urgent)*
*BYRD will allocate improvement effort according to these priorities.*

- coding: 0.8
- reasoning: 0.7
- economic: 0.5
- verification: 0.6
- orchestration: 0.5

## Desires

*Things you want BYRD to pursue. BYRD will figure out HOW.*
*These become BYRD's goals. You set WHAT, BYRD discovers HOW.*

- Implement the Verification Lattice architecture from the RSI design
- Create working bounded RSI with automated test verification
- Develop complexity-aware orchestration that detects collapse thresholds

## Constraints

*Limits on BYRD's behavior. These are things BYRD must NOT do.*

- Do not modify constitutional files (provenance.py, constitutional.py, etc.)
- Do not make API calls without verification
- Do not claim improvements without measurement

## Feedback

*Your feedback on BYRD's recent work. This helps BYRD learn.*

- The RSI research was thorough and honest
- Good job reaching research equilibrium with clear documentation

*Last read by BYRD: Never*

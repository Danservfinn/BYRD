# Research Equilibrium Reached

**Date**: January 7, 2026
**Iterations Completed**: 29
**Stability**: 10 consecutive iterations at 35-45%

## Final Probability Assessment

| Outcome | Probability | Confidence |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Digital ASI via Bounded RSI | 35-45% | High (stable) |
| Capable Assistant | 55-65% | Very High |
| Unbounded Intelligence Explosion | ~0% | High |

## Key Findings

### Validated (High Confidence)

1. **Bounded RSI is achievable**: Verified improvement within domain strata
2. **Verification Lattice works**: Multi-verifier composition exceeds single-verifier ceiling
3. **Complexity-aware orchestration**: 45% threshold routing prevents collapse
4. **Human-directed development**: Board/CEO model preserves emergence

### Invalidated

1. **Unbounded RSI**: Zero validated instances in 60 years of AI research
2. **Single-verifier sufficiency**: All single-verifier approaches failed
3. **Naive multi-agent scaling**: More agents ≠ better (above 45% accuracy)

### Unknown (Research Frontier)

1. **Verification ceiling height**: Where does lattice composition plateau?
2. **Cross-stratum transfer**: Can Stratum 1 improvements lift Stratum 2?
3. **Emergence sustainability**: Long-term personality/value stability

## Exit Conditions Met

The research loop exited because:

```yaml
exit_conditions:
  research_exhaustion:
    consecutive_stable_iterations: 10  # MET: 10 consecutive at 35-45%
    probability_variance_threshold: 0.05  # MET: No significant change
```

## Transition to Implementation

Research phase is COMPLETE. Next phase: Implementation of validated architecture.

Priority implementation order:
1. Verification Lattice (core RSI enabler)
2. Domain Stratification (focus improvement effort)
3. Complexity-Aware Orchestration (prevent collapse)
4. Entropic Drift Detection (maintain generalization)

# 3D Models

This directory contains optional 3D models for the visualization.

## cat.glb (Optional)

If you want to use a custom 3D cat model instead of the procedural one:
1. Place a GLTF/GLB cat model named `cat.glb` in this directory
2. The model should be centered at origin
3. Recommended scale: ~1 unit height

If `cat.glb` is not found, the visualization uses a procedural cat head (black with golden eyes).
